# Math_PatternRec

Write a function mAp1 that takes as input a permutation (as a Permutation object) and a mesh pattern and returns True if the permutation contains the pattern, but False otherwise. For example:
            Input: mAp1(Permutation([1,3,6,4,5,2]),
                       (Permutation([2,3,1]), [(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)]))
Output: True
